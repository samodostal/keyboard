# Personal keyboard config
I use a customized dvorak keyboard layout. There are few issues with normal dvorak keyboard layout, especially for vim programmers (symbols and numbers). That's why I came up with this layout. This is definetly not a final version, as the order of my symbols layer changes, based on my main language at the moment.

### Inspiration:
Dvorak (letters): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout<br>
Arensito (numbers and some symbols): http://www.pvv.org/~hakonhal/main.cgi/keyboard<br>

### Folder structure
`.config/karabiner` is a config for Karabiner-Elements (laptop internal keyboard)<br>
`.qmk_firmware` is a config for my main keyboard: Helidox Corne

### Helidox Corne
This is a custom built keyboard, that runs compiled C language on board, which allows for essentially any keyboard layout.<br>
